As a Marketing Analyst, I conducted an in-depth analysis of marketing campaigns for the 'Sustainable Clothing Co.' 
In this project, I addressed several key questions to assess the success of the campaigns and provided actionable insights based on the data.
The main objectives of the analysis were as follows:

* Quantifying the number of transactions completed during each marketing campaign.
* Identifying the product with the highest sales quantity.
* Determining the total revenue generated from each marketing campaign.
* Identifying the top-selling product category based on the total revenue generated.
* Analysing products that had a higher quantity sold compared to the average.
* Calculating the average revenue generated per day during the marketing campaigns.
* Evaluating the percentage contribution of each product to the total revenue.
* Comparing the average quantity sold during marketing campaigns to the quantity sold outside the campaigns.
* Comparing the revenue generated by products within and outside the marketing campaigns.
* Ranking the products based on their average daily quantity sold.

By addressing these questions and providing valuable insights, I contributed to assessing the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns 
and guiding future marketing strategies.
