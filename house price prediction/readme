This project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
The Jupyter Notebook was utilized to perform data exploration and identify potential patterns and trends within the dataset.
Feature engineering techniques were applied to transform and extract useful information from the data,
enhancing the predictive power of the model. Additionally, statistical tests were employed to select important features,
determining the variables most relevant for predicting the desired outcome.A robust predictive model was developed using regression techniques,
which achieved high accuracy on the test data. The model's performance was assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics.
